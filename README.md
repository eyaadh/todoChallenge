# ToDo Challenge

This project is a demonstration of a ToDo application that a colleague and I developed. The entire application is designed to function entirely within the browser, leveraging the Vue.js framework for its core functionality. 

### Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: The core framework for building the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for a polished and responsive user interface through its comprehensive utility classes.
- **Pinia**: Chosen for state management to integrate seamlessly with Vue.
- **Local Storage**: Implemented to ensure user data persists across browser sessions, allowing users to close and return to the app without losing their data.
- **Animations**: Incorporated `tailwindcss-animate` and `@formkit/auto-animate` for smooth transitions and interactive elements.
- **Hero Icons & Headless UI**: Used for pre-built components and icons to expedite development and avoid reinventing the wheel.

### Purpose

The primary objective of this iteration of the app is to showcase the responsive design capabilities of Tailwind CSS, as well as to demonstrate foundational Vue.js concepts.
